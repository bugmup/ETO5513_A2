## Introduction

## Analysis

### Alana's Part

1. How does total outstanding debt and number of debtors change from the financial years 2005-06 to 2021-22? 

Loading Data:
```{r}
table_8 <- read.csv("Data/HELP_DATA_TIDIED.csv")
```

Loading Libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
library(knitr)
library(bookdown)
library(eeptools)
```

Mean Debtors and Mean Outstanding Debt Summary Tables:

```{r}
# Group By Year 
table_8_year <- table_8 %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(total_number_Debtors_millions = sum(Num_Debtors)/1000000, 
            total_outstandingDebt_billions = sum(Outstanding_Debt)/1000000000)
  
kable(table_8_year, 
      caption = "Total Debtors (in millions) and Total Oustanding Debt (in billions)",
             digits = 2)
```

```{r}
totalOut_plot <- ggplot(data = table_8_year, aes(x = Year, y = total_outstandingDebt)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Total Oustanding Debt ($)") + 
  labs(title = "Total Outstanding Debt From 2005-2021", subtitle = "Among All Ages and Sex") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  geom_smooth()  + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

totalDebtors_plot <- ggplot(data = table_8_year, aes(x = Year, y = total_numDebt)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Total Number of Debtors") + 
  labs(title = "Total Number of Debtors From 2005-2021", subtitle = "Among All Ages and Sex") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  geom_smooth()  + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)


grid.arrange(totalOut_plot, totalDebtors_plot, nrow = 2)
```

2. Which groups are at risk of high debt? 

Looking At Sex:

```{r}
# Group By Year 
table_8_sex <- table_8 %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_number_Debtors = mean(Num_Debtors), 
            mean_outstandingDebt_billions = mean(Outstanding_Debt)/1000000000)

kable(table_8_sex, 
      caption = "Average Number of Debtors and Outstanding Debt (in billions) from 2005-2021",
             digits = 2)
```

```{r}
table_8_sex_year <- table_8 %>%
  group_by(Sex, Year) %>%
  summarise(mean_number_Debtors = mean(Num_Debtors), 
            mean_outstandingDebt_billions = mean(Outstanding_Debt)/1000000000)


plot3 <- ggplot(data = table_8_sex_year, aes(x = Year, y = mean_number_Debtors, col = Sex)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Mean Number of Debtors") + 
  labs(title = "Mean Number of Debtors From 2005-2021", subtitle = "Among All Ages") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  geom_smooth()  + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)


plot4 <- ggplot(data = table_8_sex_year, aes(x = Year, y = mean_outstandingDebt_billions, col = Sex)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ylab("Mean Outstanding Debt ($) in billions") + 
  labs(title = "Mean Outstanding Debt From 2005-2021", subtitle = "Among All Ages") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  geom_smooth()  + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

grid.arrange(plot3, plot4, nrow = 2)

```
